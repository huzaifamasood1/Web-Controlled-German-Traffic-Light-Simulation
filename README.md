# Web-Controlled-German-Traffic-Light-Simulation
Software: Arduino IDE (Legacy Edition), HTML, JavaScript, C++ Designed and implemented a functional simulation of a German style 4-state traffic light system using an ESP8266 microcontroller.
• Web Interface Hosting: A responsive and visually styled traffic light control webpage hosted directly on the
ESP8266 using LittleFS.
• Real-Time LED Control: Light buttons synchronized with physical LEDs connected to the microcontroller.
• Wi-Fi Integration: Enabled wireless control and monitoring via a local network, with server-side routing for LED
commands.
• UI/UX Design: Developed an engaging front-end with animated backgrounds and interactive elements using
HTML and JavaScript.
